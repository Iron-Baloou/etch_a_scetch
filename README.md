# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a web-based drawing application that allows users to create colorful drawings by hovering over a grid of cells. It provides a simple and interactive way to unleash your creativity!

## Features

1. Reset/Start Button: Clicking the "Reset/Start" button clears the drawing grid and resets it to the initial state.

2. Raster Size Input: Users can enter the desired size of the drawing grid by clicking the "Rastergroesse Eingabe" (Raster Size Input) button. The grid will be updated accordingly.

3. Drawing Grid: The drawing grid consists of multiple cells arranged in rows and columns. Each cell represents a pixel on the canvas. Hovering over a cell changes its background color to a random RGB value, creating a colorful drawing effect.
